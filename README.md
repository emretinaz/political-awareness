# Political Awareness - New Zealand
Why this platform created? I believe there is a relationship problem betweeen citizens and politicians/political parties. I created this platform to help citizens and political parties to undestand each other better.

There are 3 sections in this platform :

Understanding each party's purpose. Most of the citizens can only name 5 political parties however there are 17 parties to vote and including with unregistred parties, the number reaches 22 options for the NZ citizens. Therefore, this platform aims to get know every single options when it comes to voting. Many people dont like the politics and dont feel like to vote because they dont like the popular parties and dont know the 75 percent unpopular parties because of the media. So in this platform every party will be equal.

This platform also aims to find out what people things about each party positively and negatively. Therefore we can see that what parties good and bad at according to citizens. Then we can easly compare parties and politicians can also understand what citizens think about them in general.

Eventually, this platform can also help citizens to express their ideas or desires from a imaginary political party what to focus on and avoid most. Therefore political parties can see what citizens care most and least.
